# Hungry-Tummies




BUSINESS CASE

Executive Summary
This business case outlines how the Hungry Tummies Project will address the current availability of home-cooked foods and it's systematic availability. The business case will describe issues, recommendations, project goals, performance measures, assumptions along with benefits of implementing the project and justification of the project.

Issue
In the current scenario, there's hardly any digital platform for buying and selling home cooked food. There's a dearth of places / restaurants where extremely authentic, home cooked food at a reasonable rate is available to everyone. The restaurant cooked food is either not liked by many, is expensive or not authentic enough for most people. There's an imbalance in the demand and means of supply for home cooked food services. Centered around these issues, our 'Hungry Tummies' application aims to make buying and selling of home cooked food easier and accessible for those who need at an extremely nominal price.

Anticipated Outcomes
Implementing an application wherein the above-mentioned issues will be addressed in the best possible way. This application will address:
• The Cooks once registered and authenticated for their authorization to cook, can post menus and accept requests
• The Customers once registered, can browse though menus, cooks and place orders on available menus.
A means where the cooks and the customers can communicate with each other as and when required

Recommendation
Various options and alternatives were analyzed to determine the best way to leverage technology to provide Hungry Tummy services to the end users. The Hungry Tummies Application would be available on App Stores for the end users to install them on their mobile devices. The application would be accessible from the web as well. Thus, a person can access the app instantly from his/her mobile. The customers could also avail door to door service for food delivery using the app.

Justification
With the advancement in technology, world being connected through the internet and customer services accessible on finger tips it is perhaps fitting that we see the use of the technological advancements in the field of supply and delivery of home cooked food. Currently, there are applications for delivery of food from restaurants, but no applications for delivering or accessing home cooked foods. This app will be of prime use to:
• Those looking for inexpensive, authentic delicacies for example international students who do not find restaurants with the preferred delicacies.
• Those who want to try new tastes but do not want to go to the restaurants
• Home cooks looking for a means to sell their food and / or expand their business
